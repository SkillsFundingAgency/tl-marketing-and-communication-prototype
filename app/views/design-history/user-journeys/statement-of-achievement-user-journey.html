        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Journey overview</h2>
        <p>Providers request a statement of achievement for students who have not completed their T level and not received a complete T level certificate.</p>
        <p>The SoA details what the learner has attained whilst on the T level course:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>T Level title</li>
            <li>Technical qualification for example: Core and or Occupational specialism</li>
            <li>Other T Level requirements for example: Maths and English status</li>
        </ul>
