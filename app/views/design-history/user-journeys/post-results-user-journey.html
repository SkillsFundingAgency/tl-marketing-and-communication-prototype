        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Journey overview</h2>
        <p>AO's inform ESFA of students results for each registered component.</p>
        <p>Users add a result against components (Core and or Specialism(s)) for registered assessment entries.</p>
        <p>For example if a student has taken an exam for their core in the summer of 2021, the AO must be able to update our service with the grade that the learner achieved for that exam.</p>
