        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Journey overview</h2>
        <p>Awarding organisations first task when interacting with the service is to confirm which T Levels they will be
            delivering.</p>
        <p>Once completed, this task will be done on an ad-hoc basis as and when the awarding organisation adds or stops
            delivering T Levels. </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">End users</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Registrations Editor (user role in the service)</li>
            <li>Administrators</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pre requisites before adding assessments</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>AO must have reviewed the T Levels they offer within the R&C service.</li>
            <li>AO must have reviewed which providers will offer their T Levels.</li>
            <li>AO must have registered the learners from their providers.</li>
            <li>Providers must have informed AOs which learners will be taking which exams when e.g. who will be taking core exams in Summer 2021.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Current Functionality</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Users are able to bulk upload of up to 10000 registrations in a single CSV file.</li>
            <li>Users are able to query any of the above T Levels if the details are incorrect.</li>
            <li>Users are able to see all of the T Levels they have confirmed are correct.</li>
        </ul>
