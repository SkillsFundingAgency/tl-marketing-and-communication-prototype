4th November, 2021

Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Comments:

On the 2nd November we had a team meeting where a business decision was made:

- Redesign data export to only allow full data downloads of registration, assessments, and results
- Keep home dashboard option (OPTION A) and in registration/assessment/results option (OPTION B) to do A/B testing with users
- Review how we share what information they will get with each type of download (i.e. the different columns of information the downloads will have)
- Agreed that the home dashboard option (OPTION A) will have a dynamic element only showing viable options (i.e. if they have no assessment data, it will not give them option to download assessment data)

Changes:

- We removed the Start screen when accesing download data individually on Registrations, Assessments, results

- We changed the content on the Start Screen to say 'A data file can only be created if you have already successfully uploaded data into this service.'

- For user testing we had different versions of the data export:

1) Download the data with the 3 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type

2) Download the data with the 2 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type-double

3) Download the data with 1 option: 
/select-data-type-single

4) Download the data, allowing the user to select the optional data 
The optional data screen has been redesigned to include a list of what info is included by default
'All' was removed in this instance as a business decision as this isn't part of the published GDS pattern
/select-data-type-list

5) No data found 
/no-data-found
