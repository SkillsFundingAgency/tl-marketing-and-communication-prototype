Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:
The prototype was created and merged onto Main with the following changes:

- Error messages where added to the cohort, learner status and assessment periods 

- If the user doesn't have any data n, the no data screen appears when the user clicks 
Download data from the home screen or the individual sections.

- In the check-your-data screens the title registrations, assessments or results changes
depending on what selection the user has made. Text has been added 'By submitting 
your data you are confirming that, to the best of your knowledge, the 
details you are providing are correct.', the button changed from 'Submit'
to 'Submit-your-data'

- Processing-data-file screen has been added after the user clicks 'Submit-your-data'
to allow the data file to process before the user can download it. 

- On the 'Your data is ready' page we changed the button to 'Download more data' instead
of 'Select your CSV data again' and got rid of the extra line of text regarding the 
download file.
