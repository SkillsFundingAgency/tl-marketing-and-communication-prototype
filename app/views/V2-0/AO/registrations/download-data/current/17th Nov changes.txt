Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Comments:

From the meeting today we concluded that:

The Registrations, Assessments and Results would be better in their individual 
areas instead of on the home screen with the default columns included. 

If the user downloads Registrations data it would have the Status filter included
with Active, Withdrawn and Certified inlcuded. 

Changes:

- Remove the Download data from the home screen and put in the individual sections of 
Registrations, Assessments and Results. 

- If the user downloads Registrations data it would have the Status filter included
with Active, Withdrawn and Certified inlcuded while there is no filter for 
Assessments and Results. 

- The 'Download more data' button on the data is ready screen has been changed to 'Back to home'
with the button changed to green

- The breadcrumbs have been updated to end with the parent section of the home page
