Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:

- Move the buttons around on the 'No records found' page so that the buttons are above the 'Get help'... text

- Remove the word 'Download' on the data is ready screen and change 'Download data' to 'Download registations data'
