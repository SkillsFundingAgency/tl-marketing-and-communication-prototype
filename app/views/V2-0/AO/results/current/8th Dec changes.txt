Results: 

Details page will show all exam periods the learner has entered for Core & Specialism

Changes: 

- We decided to move the Status to be next to the Grade because it relates to the grade 
while actions to add/change a result are titled in the column at the end under 'Action' 

- We changed the titles of core and specialism to 'Core component' and 
'Occupationial specialism' 

- We added a details component at the bottom of the page called 'More about learner results'
with information about the learner results in

- We decided to seperate the UKPRN from the provider in 'Learner details' 

- We made a business decision to leave 'Not received' in on the 'Add/change' results as users mentioned 
that they need to revert changes
