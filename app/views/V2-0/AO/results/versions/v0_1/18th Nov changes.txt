Results: 

Details page will show all exam periods the learner has entered for Core & Specialism

Based off the UR sessions we concluded that the Core and Specialism should be on seperate pages 
because the user has alot of information to scroll to. 

Changes: 

- Logic has been added in so that when the user enters Withdrawn or Registrations it goes straight to 
that screen 

- If there is any other valid ULN it will go to the select-result-type screen where the user selects
a core or specialism result 

- Core and Specialism result pages have been created so that the user knows which screen they are on 

- A button has been added next to the 'Search again' green button for if the user wants to switch 
between the Core/Specialism results 

- If the learner don't have a Specialism, the user can still access the specialism page but a 
notification would appear 

- The success page has changed so that when the learner adds or changes a result a notification 
appears on the page instead of having a separate page 


- If there are paired Specialisms we had two ideas. One idea was having a screen before the 
user gets to the specialism page where they can choose which specialism they'd like. The other 
is a tab menu where they can switch between specialisms
