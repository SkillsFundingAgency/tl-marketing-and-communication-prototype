Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:
In initial design discussion today with Josie, Ned, Rajesh G, Leah, Rachel, Kap, it was 
agreed that Ned and Josie will go ahead with 2 designs. 

- Where there would be an option to create bulk download from inside the registration, assessment entries and results sections.
- Where there would be a bulk download section from within the dashboard in which you can then choose which bulk download section you want (between registration, assessment entires, and results.

It was also agreed that the filters will be:

- registration will be filtered by academic year and status
- assessment entries will be filtered by assessment series
- results will be filtered by assessment series

Changes:
The initial data export designs where made using GOVUK Design system flow diagram in Miro. We
then took the flow diagram and created the first prototype.
