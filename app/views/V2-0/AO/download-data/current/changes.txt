5th November, 2021

Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Comments:

On the 5th November we prepared a prototype with the option to allow for filtering as users 
said they would like the high level filter options such as session or series as this would save them from filtering in the CSV file. 

Changes:

- Added on option to allow the user to filter. Another option that we can test on users to see if filters are really necessary.
/select-data-file-type-filters

- If there are multiple filters they are displayed on one page

- 'All' option has been removed as a business decision from the filters and optional columns 
as this reduces the processing time. Also 'All' isn't part of the published GDS pattern so 
we'll test this idea. 

- The user is able to download real example data for Registrations, Assessments and Results 

- On the default and additional data screen the wording was changed to become clearer for the users.
