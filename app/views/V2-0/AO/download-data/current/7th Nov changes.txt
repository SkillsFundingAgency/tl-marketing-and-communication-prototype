7th November, 2021

Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Comments:

From the user testing on the 5th November, we concluded that:

- Users might need to filter the download to what they want 
but it depends on the Qty of the spreadsheet so as numbers 
increase they may want to filter the rows

- They liked the distinct areas better to separate it out instead of 
having download data section on the home screen

- If there was a larger dataset the check your answers screen 
would be necessary so in this case there are only a few 
filter option so it isn’t necessary

- Clarify what is the optional data in the additonal data section

- We like that it shows us what data is going to be in the file beforehand 
but after they've download it a few times they'd become familiar with the data

- Having separate sections for the Registrations, Assessments and 
Results makes sense to download the data

- Just a straight download would be great but as the numbers 
increase to a lot of rows I’d want the filters.

Scenarios:

1) Download the data with the 3 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type

2) Download the data with the 2 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type-double

3) Download the data with 1 option: 
/select-data-type-single

4) Download the data, allowing the user to select the optional data 
The optional data screen has been redesigned to include a list of what info is included by default
'All' was removed in this instance as a business decision as this isn't part of the published GDS pattern
/select-data-type-list

5) No data found 
/no-data-found

6) Download the data with filters:
/select-data-file-type-filters

Changes:

- The check your data screen has been removed so the users go straight to generating a CSV File
