Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:

- Default and additional data screens have been changed because from user testing we found that after the 
users download the data a few times, the list of default data isn't necessary. 

- Download data has been added as a sub header to screens within download data 

- Additional data has been changed to optional data on te optional data screen 

- No data found screen has been updated 

Scenarios:

1) Download the data with the 3 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type

2) Download the data with the 2 options to instally generate the CSV
/select-data-type-double

3) Download the data with 1 option: 
/select-data-type-single

4) Download the data, allowing the user to select the optional data 
The optional data screen has been redesigned to include a list of what info is included by default
'All' was removed in this instance as a business decision as this isn't part of the published GDS pattern
/select-data-type-list

5) No data found 
/no-data-found

6) Download the data with filters:
/select-data-file-type-filters
