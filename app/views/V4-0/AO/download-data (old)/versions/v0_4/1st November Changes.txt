Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:

- On the start page a list is created to tell the user what they will download

- 'All' has been added onto Optional Columns to allow the user to select all options 
at once. 

- The screens where seperated out further so when the user downloaded the data, they would have 
the right one

- On the check-your-data screen, the title text has been changed to 'Check-your-selections'.
Other text has changed to 'Click submit to generate a CSV file containing the data 
detailed above. 

- The 'Submit-your-data' button has been changed to 'Submit' with a start again button
added at this stage for the user to go back to the Start screen to start the process again. 

- A Download data section has been created in Assessments, giving an example of what it 
would be like if the user download the data in an individual section. v0.4
