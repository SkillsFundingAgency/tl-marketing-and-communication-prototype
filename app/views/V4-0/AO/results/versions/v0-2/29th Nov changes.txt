Results: 

Details page will show all exam periods the learner has entered for Core & Specialism

Changes: 

- Itâ€™s better to have Core and Specialism in a table all on one page because it removes 
that slight make me think moment. 

- Although from the UR sessions, the users mentioned there would be too much scrolling,
having the data in a table instead of a summary list would save alot less space so there 
wouldn't be as much scrolling. 

- Preferences is not measured by 5-6 people which is how many we have to test the table 
idea so we got internal feedback instead and decided this was a better option. 

- The correct grades have been added in for the specialism result. 

- Select 'Type of result' and 'Choose which specialism results' screens
have been removed. Core and specialism are all on one page. 

- Added 'Status' as a column in the table
