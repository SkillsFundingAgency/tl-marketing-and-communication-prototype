Results: 

Details page will show all exam periods the learner has entered for Core & Specialism

Team decisions: 

- The learner does not have any registered assessments screen is obsolete 
and has been removed 

- We are thinking about changing the status to ensure that users know what each status means
because in certain instances there are multiple statuses within core and specialism such as
Being Appealed and Final 

- We are thinking about how the screen will appear if there is just the core without the specialims 
and where to include the link to add more specialisms

- We need to decide whether or not 'Being Appealed' needs to link to the appeals section 

Changes: 

- The tLevelsStudentData.csv file has been updated to inclued the second specialism 

- Info about the statuses has been put into a details component at the bottom of the screen

- The status of the grade is now next to the grade so it's separate from the action

- If there is a 'Add result' then the 'Action' column appears otherwise it isn't there if the result 
has already been added
