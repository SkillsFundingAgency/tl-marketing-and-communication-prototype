        <p class="govuk-body">You can download the results for all of your active learners who are in the final year of their T Level.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">The results will be available as a CSV file the day before each results day.</p>


        <p class="govuk-body">The results in the file may be updated after results day if:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a grade has changed due to a review or appeal</li>
            <li>a learner has completed their industry placement</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">The file will update each time you download it. Any changes to results will be updated on the results file on the next working day.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The results file will not be updated after:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>31 May for overall results provided at the end of the autumn series</li>
            <li>31 October for overall results provided at the end of the summer series</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Following these dates, you will need to look at individual learner records for up-to-date results.</p>
