Scenario:
As an AO data admin/manager, I need to check what data has been 
uploaded in the system so I be reassured what has been uploaded 
and identify issues upfront.

Changes:

On th data is ready screen 'Download data' has been changed to 'Download Results data'. Instead of 'core' 
and 'Specialism' we've changed it to 'Core components' and 'Occupational specialisms'

On the no records found page: Move buttons up above text. ‘learner’s’
