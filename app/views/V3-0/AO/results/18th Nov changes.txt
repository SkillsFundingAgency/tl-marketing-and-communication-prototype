Based off the UR sessions we concluded that the Core and Specialism should be on seperate pages 
because the user has alot of information to scroll to. 

Changes: 

- Logic has been added in so that when the user enters Withdrawn or Registrations it goes straight to 
that screen 

- If there is any other valid ULN it will go to the select-result-type screen where the user selects
a core or specialism result 

- Core and Specialism result pages have been created so that the user knows which screen they are on 

- A button has been added next to the 'Search again' green button for if the user wants to switch 
between the Core/Specialism results 

- If the learner don't have a Specialism a scenario has been included for this
